% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to \LaTeX{} to determine where to break
% the lines. Using \AND forces a linebreak at that point. So, if \LaTeX{}
% puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last on the second
% line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\begin{question}[1 ]
\end{question}
\begin{solution}
It is known that 
\eQb
\text{The concentration of A} &=& \text{ The concentration of T} \\
\text{The concentration of G} &=& \text{ The concentration of C},
\eQe
and the above four bases are the only bases present.
Consequently, as we have that the concentration of $A$ is $19\%$, 
we have the following concentrations of each bases:
\eQb
\text{The concentration of A} &=& 19\% \\
\text{The concentration of T} &=& 19\% \\
\text{The concentration of G} &=& 31\% \\
\text{The concentration of C} &=& 31\%. 
\eQe

\end{solution}

\begin{question}[2 ]
\end{question}
\begin{solution}
One base pair gives 4 possibilities. Since $\log_4(321948059) \approx 
14.13$, it is required to have $15$ base pairs to have at least
$321$ million different possible DNA sequence.
 
\end{solution}

\bigskip

\begin{question}[3 ]
\end{question}
\begin{solution}

\textbf{(a)} We have the following relation:
\eQb
\text{Heritability} &=& \dfrac{\text{Transmitted Variation}}
{\text{Phenotypic Variation}}. 
\eQe
Since the heritability of the trait is $0.5$, 
half of the total phenotypic variation of the trait
in the population, is attributed to the genotypic variation. 

\smallskip

\textbf{(b)} If the population became a socialist utopia where 
everyone had perfect access to resources, the heritability of the 
trait will increase over the succeeding generation. As the environmental
factors will have less variance, and phenotypic variation will decrease,
while the genetic variation, with its
underlying principles not changed, will remain constant. Hence, the
denominator of heritability stays the same, and the numerator decreases.
Therefore, heritability will increase.
 

\smallskip

\textbf{(c)} The question entirely depends on the nature of
phenotype under consideration. For instance, for an adult,
it is much harder to find a way to change the lung volume,
then change his or her hair color. 

\end{solution}

\begin{question}[4 ]
\end{question}
\begin{solution}
\textbf{(a)} 
The figure 1 helix is right-handed, when the figure 2 helix is left-handed.

\smallskip

\textbf{(b)} The figure 2 helix has a major groove and a minor groove,
when the figure 1 helix does not.

\smallskip

\textbf{(c)} Both figures have a proper 
combinatorial constraint with base-pairing.
The figure 1 has purple-green, green-purple, red-blue, and blue-red base
pairs.
The figure 2 has red-green, green-red, blue-yellow, and yellow-blue 
base pairs.
